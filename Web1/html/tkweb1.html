                This is <b><i>paragraph</i></b> one. Ants are colonial animals. They live in colonies having a queen
                being in the brain. If the queen dies, everyone dies.
            </p>
            <p>
                But I don't want to talk too much about <b><i>ANTS</i></b> because I don't know so much about ants. A friend of mine does
                but he's not here and there aren't any reasons to ask him to write this for me, because this is just
                testing html paragraph and I just wanted to write something long in paragraphs lol.
